You will need to API keys from Bitmex and Binance Futures (The world's leading cryptocurrency trading platforms). These can be created by creating accounts on their sites. They allow actions such as creating orders or getting the status of a placed order. For testing purposes, use https://testnet.bitmex.com/ and https://testnet.binancefuture.com/en/futures/BTCUSDT. These sites are alternative Bitcoin block chains to be used for testing. This allows application developers or bitcoin testers to experiment, without having to use real bitcoins or worrying about breaking the main bitcoin chain.
